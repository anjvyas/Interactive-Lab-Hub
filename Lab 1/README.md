# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

### Feedback
As I faced some technical issues during the lab, I wasn't able to get feedback on my storyboards from my group. However, I did show them to my friends and they suggested:
- The lights could potentially be distracting for professors as they try to teach.
- It would be helpful to make the hydratinator and miss you machine more portable somehow (maybe they could take up the form of wearables of some kind or smaller devices that can latch onto a laptop itself).
- The light brightness/intensity should be adjustable, especially for the night light.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

I acted out the interactions corresponding to the first 3 storyboards shown above by using tinkerbelle on my phone as well as laptop. The device screen was the phone's screen and I used the laptop to changet the colors. As I was acting out the interaction I realised that the lights might be a little dim to catch the attention of a person and adding some kind of sound might be necessary.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
I really enjoyed using Tinkerbelle! The only feedback I have for it is that it is a bit confusing to figure out what the Jane Wren and Tinkerbelle buttons do without any labels.

## Part D. Wizard the device
I did not face any trouble wizarding the device and setting everything up. I made use of some tape, colored paper and markers for this.

## Part E. Costume the device

I wanted to keep the design as simple as possible while making sure to add some colors and playfulness :)

## Part F. Record
[![Staging Interactions Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3Q6mQROwuEc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3Q6mQROwuEc)


I filmed the interactions video by myself and made use of iMovie! The hydratinator name was inspired by Dr. Doofenshmirtz because he adds "inator" to all his inventions' names and the idea was inspired by this awesome bottle I recently started using - https://hidratespark.com.



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
