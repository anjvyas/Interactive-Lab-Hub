# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

### Storyboards and Scenarios

#### The Miss You Machine
I'm an international student from India and I often miss my family and friends back home. Sometimes when my parents call, I am distracted with work and I don't pick up. Sometimes, when I call them, they are at work. With the miss you machine, loved ones can just send positive thoughts through a click and they would show up as pink glowing on the device. This helps remind them that you are thinking of them even though it may be difficult to find times to talk on a call :)

#### Hydratinator
When I am in my zone while studying or working, I often forget to drink water for hours. Then my head starts hurting and it takes me a while to realize that I just need to drink water. The hydratinator aims to solve this by glowing blue periodically to remind the user to stay hydrated!

#### Weather Buddy
A lot of times when I leave home in a rush, I forget to check the weather and don't grab my umbrella. Sometimes I end up feeling cold because I underestimate how chilly it is going to be. Even though it is easy to swipe left and check the weather app or ask Google/Siri, I forget to do it. I would appreciate a visual reminder that I can see right in front of me as I am leaving my home or getting ready. This is why I believe 'weather buddy' would be useful - it can make sounds and change colors based on the weather!

#### A simple way to grab a prof's attention from the back of a big classroom
I have often sat in classrooms that are very big and I can imagine it being difficult for professors to see people raising their hands. This light device might be a good solution for this issue. Different colors can also be used to signify different things.

#### A spooky interactive halloween decoration
I love halloween and thought of making a spooky ghost decoration that can be placed in a pitch dark room. When someone enters, the lights can turn on and make a spooky sound!

#### A night light + sleep sounds player
Sometimes sounds of the city can make it difficult to sleep so a white noise machine or peaceful sound player can help a lot.

#### A book light that can play ambient sounds
To emulate the feeling of curling up by a bonfire, or sitting in a park or any kind of nature related setting while sitting right at home and reading a book. The light's colors can also be changed to make reading feel even more magical :)

### Feedback
As I faced some technical issues during the lab, I wasn't able to get feedback on my storyboards from my group. However, I did show them to my friends and they suggested:
- The lights could potentially be distracting for professors as they try to teach.
- It would be helpful to make the hydratinator and miss you machine more portable somehow (maybe they could take up the form of wearables of some kind or smaller devices that can latch onto a laptop itself).
- The light brightness/intensity should be adjustable, especially for the night light.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

I acted out the interactions corresponding to the first 3 storyboards shown above by using tinkerbelle on my phone as well as laptop. The device screen was the phone's screen and I used the laptop to change the colors. As I was acting out the interaction I realised that the lights might be a little dim to catch the attention of a person and adding some kind of sound might be necessary.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
I really enjoyed using Tinkerbelle! The only feedback I have for it is that it is a bit confusing to figure out what the Jane Wren and Tinkerbelle buttons do without any labels.

## Part D. Wizard the device
I did not face any trouble wizarding the device and setting everything up. I made use of some tape, colored paper and markers for this.

## Part E. Costume the device

I wanted to keep the design as simple as possible while making sure to add some colors and playfulness :)

## Part F. Record
[![Staging Interactions Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3Q6mQROwuEc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3Q6mQROwuEc)


I filmed the interactions video by myself and made use of iMovie! The hydratinator name was inspired by Dr. Doofenshmirtz because he adds "inator" to all his inventions' names and the idea was inspired by this awesome bottle I recently started using - https://hidratespark.com.



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

## Part A. Plan 

### Storyboards and Scenarios
I wanted to build on some of the feedback that I received for the prototypes in part 1. I realized that the original prototypes would not be very convenient for users because they are not portable. Putting myself in their shoes, I realized that if I am out and about or even just not at home, I would not take a stand and big display along with me. I also wanted to explore what it would be like to combine the functionality of the 3 devices into one because it did not seem very difficult to do so.

This is why I envisioned the new device to be much smaller than the original ones (the size of an apple watch screen) and it can be affixed to any surface with some materials and casing that come with it to provide flexibility for the people using it.

### Feedback
This is the feedback I received from the people at my table:
- Maybe stick to one idea so it's not confusing for the user - at least initially.
- Rahul thought the hydration one was probably the most useful one that I could start off with.
- Also brought up the point of how each different purpose would require different backend functionality to make it work. For instance the miss you machine functionality would require an app and account system that can let loved ones click and send a positive thought to the right machine somehow. The hydratinator functionality would need a timer system that can be adjusted by the user to specify their preferred goals and frequency. Lastly, the weather buddy would need visuals / animations for many different scenarios and also be able to pull and use data from a weather API somehow. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

I acted out the interactions corresponding to a few of the storyboards shown above by using tinkerbelle on my iPad as well as apple watch (after removing the band and following the steps in [this article](https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-use-internet-on-apple-watch/) as apple watches don't directly offer browsers). The device screen was the apple watch's screen and my friend used the laptop to change the colors.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
Another minor idea I have for tinkerbelle is - it would be nice to be able to hide the buttons and color picker so the interaction looks more natural.

## Part D. Wizard the device
I did not face any trouble wizarding the device and setting everything up. I just removed the watch band from my watch and placed it on the surface of interest (I did not use tape because I did not want to damage the screen).
